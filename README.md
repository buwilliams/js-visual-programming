# Experimenting with Visual Programming

So far you can:

- open index.html in your browser (uses canvas 2d)
- right-click to create a square
- drag that square around
- make as many squares as you like

Vision:

- drag and drop "squares"
- various "squares" to represent code
- render code visually, as something to mold
- create data "squares" which allow data to flow through connected "squares"
